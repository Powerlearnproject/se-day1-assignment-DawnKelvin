#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering princples and knowledge of programming languages to develop software solutions for end users.
Software engineering is important in the technology industry as it focuses on developing solutions based on end user needs. Software engineers develop applications and systems that are used by end users for example to automate processes, network and flow controls, video gaming, data analysis, data mining and data management. These applications help busines and users to efficiently operate and manage their operations, reducing costs and better managing their clients. Software engineers are technically problem-solvers, applying their expertise to solve real-world problems through technology, improving processes through innovative software products.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Software engineeering has evolved from being an art to being recognized as a field of engineering . The three key milestones in the evolution are;
i) Software engineering as an art. This is the first phase of the evolution where software development was primarily done by individuals and teams, writing code based on their experience and intuition. Developers wrote programs in unplanned and unorganized manner. This appproach however was unsustainable as the need for a more structured way of programming grew.
ii) Development of formal methods for software design and development such structured programming using flowcharts to represent algorithms. Here sofware engineering was seen  more as a craft
iii) The introduction of object-oriented programming methods which saw the emergence of the two software development methodologies, that is, Agile and Waterfall methodologies. This marked the beginning of software engineering as a well-established engineering field. The approach to software development here is more scientific and systematic.
 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
i) Planning. Here the project goals are defined based on end user needs, timelines are set, budget estimates created and roles assigned in case of a team project.
ii) Design. This involves designing the user experience and user interface modules. It lays out the overall architecture of the product.
iii) Development. This is the phase where the actual coding of the product happen. 
iv) Testing. The goal of this phase is to find bugs before the end product is released to the users.
v) Deployment. In this phase the software is put up for users to start using it. It is the launch of the product after successful development and testing.
vi) Maintenance.This is the post-launch care where any bugs arising from its use are fixed, new features added or issue product updates.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a linear approach to software development where one step must finish before going to the next while  Agile is more flexible focusing on small and rapid cycles at a time. Agile is well suited for projects with uncertain requirements or frequent modifications since it is flexible and responsive to change unlike waterfall which is rigid and structured. Waterfall is well suited for projects with a high volume of documentation and have repeatable, predictable processes

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer is responsible for writing code and developing the entire software product, collaborating with other team members. He/she also works on updates and report to the project manager.
Quality Assurance engineer ensures that the product is free of bugs before it is deployed. He creates tests that identify bugs and also monitor every phase of the development process to ensure quality is maintained and that the final product meets the requirements.
Project manager leads the software development team. He links the clients who define the project requirements and the software developers who execute the project. The manager defines the scope of the project, allocate resources, set timelines and supervise each stage of the development process. He also delivers the completed product to clients and regularly check its performance.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs help programmers develop software code efficiently. It eases the coding process by combining functions such as software editing, building, testing and packaging in an easy to use application. They provide common developer tools such as automated code editing, syntax highlighting, compilation, testing and debugging.
Version control systems  help monitor and record every change made to the software. This simplifies tracking changes and enable collaboration and easy reversal of changes if needed.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Unsestablished project infrastructure - solved by ensuring development, test and prouction  environments are available at every phase of the development process.
Keeping up with changing requirements - solved by creating a clear and concise requirements document and clear communication of the needs between the development teams.
Quality assurance - encourage use of best code development practices to meet requirements rather than suppressing errors.
Adapting to the latest market trends - constantly upskill to remain relevant, stay up-to-date on market trends.
Proper Software project management - leverage project management tools.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing -  tests individual software components in isolation, ensuring each component functions correctly. It is important in detecting and fixing bugs early in development.
Integration testing - it combines software units and tests them as a group. It is important in finding interface defects between modules and determines how efficiently units run together.
System testing - tests the final software product in relation to the computer system it is part of. It ensures the product works correctly with software and hardware systems.
Acceptance testing - assesses whether the final software is ready for release. It ensures that it meets the end user's needs.
All these testing types ensures that the final product complies against defined standards and meets the quality criteria.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process where a user gives instructions to generative AI tools in order for it to give the desired output. Prompt engineering is important in generating most appropriate formats, phrases, words and symbols that guide the AI tool to generate more specific and accurate responses to the user. They make AI applications more efficient and effective.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: "Where can I purchase a good laptop for software programming classes?"
Impoved prompt: "You are a sales assistant for an electronics company. A user based in Westlands, Nairobi, Kenya, is asking where to purchase a good laptop for software programming classes. Respond with the three nearest electronics shop locations that currently stocks the laptops."
The improved prompt is more effective because it refines the location of the electronic shops to within Nairobi and only gives the three nearest locations rather than an extensive list spanning a large geographical area.
